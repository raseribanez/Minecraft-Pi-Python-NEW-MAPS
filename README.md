Worlds...Codes...Awesomeness

Note
====
I did not make these worlds, I am just organizing some that work on the Pi for others to make use of
It would take me a decade of Sundays to make just one of these awesome worlds

I found out that MCPI can accept maps or worlds from MCPE after all it is just a fork of the Pocket edition So...I went map crazy and goat a while load of them off the Minecraft Forum site

These worlds aren't mine, but they DO work on the Raspberry Pi version of Minecraft.

ALSO
=====
If you play MCPI the worlds are pretty boring...these NEW worlds enable mobs...YES, sheep, pigs, chickens, ZOMBIES it really opens up the game. There are scripts to create mobs using Python, but I cannot say I have got them to work as yet.


To add a new world heres what you do
=====================================

* Clone the repository
* Extract a world you want to try (unzip)
* Either have the world ready on a USB, or just extract it from inside Raspbian
* Boot up your Pi or virtual version of Raspbian
* Open up the filesystem
* Go to the menu up top, select View
* Enable "Show Hidden"
* Now you see Loads more files
* Find the minecraft directory
* Open it
* Find the Worlds directory and in there is your saved worlds
* Just drag n drop the world folder into this directory
* You can rename your existing worlds while you're there
* Load up MCPI, Start game and scroll across to the new World

I recommend trying the Hogwarts one - it is EPIC!
